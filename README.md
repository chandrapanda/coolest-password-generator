# coolest-password-generator
Welcome to the Coolest Password Generator! Users can generate passwords randomly that meet certain criteria.

When a user visits the website, they are able to generate a random password based on options they may choose. The options include: special characters (symbols), numbers, lower-case letters, and upper-case letters. The user must enter a character count between 8 and 128.

If a user chooses a number less than 8 or more than 128, they receive an error message and returns to the main screen. If a user does not choose any criteria, they will receive an error message stating that they need to choose at least one option.

Copy button added so that user can easily copy the text to their clipboard, to use their password anywhere on their computer or device.
